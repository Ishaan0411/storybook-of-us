                <p>"But I also know that despite how much I care for you, I’ve been struggling. I sometimes don’t understand you the way I should, and it's hurtful to both of us."</p>
                <p>"There have been times when I’ve let little things bother me too much—too much to the point where I overthink and distance myself from you."</p>
                <p>"And I know that made you stop sharing with me, and for that, I’m truly sorry. I never wanted that to happen."</p>
                <p>"This feeling, this love, it’s something I’ve never experienced before. And sometimes, it makes me act in ways I can't even explain."</p>
                <p>"I feel so guilty for the constant fights, and I promise, from the bottom of my heart, I’ll do better. I’ll always be here, I’ll work on myself, and I’ll stay with you forever. I’m not perfect, but I want to be better for you. I love you more than words can say, and I’m sorry for making you feel like this."</p>
